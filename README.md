Implementable is a multilingual microservices framework. Its design is based on the following ideas:

* Microservices can be implemented in any language.
* Microservices should have strong, enforced interface contracts.
  * Capable type system
  * Clear domain model ownership model
* Latency and failures are unavoidable.
 * Message pipelining & batching
 * Failure mitigation & recovery strategies
* All messages should traced for monitoring and debugging.

## Status

Implementable is currently a work in progress and is definitely not suitable for production yet.
